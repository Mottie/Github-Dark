#### Version 1.4.3 (11/5/2013)

#### Version 1.4.2 (11/5/2013)

* Fixed gist tab color.
* Fixed gist title color.
* Various improvements to graphs (graphs page)
  * Note: GitHub uses rendered grey-on-white images for the graph previews here,
    and the best way to handle them would probably be filter: invert, which isn't supported
    on Firefox yet, so we just reduce the opacity (and contrast) for now.
  * See [issue #53](https://github.com/Mottie/Github-Dark/issues/53) for the discussion.
* Update default syntax highlight, improve box headers.
* Tweak borders, fix section link colors.
* Commit page:
  * Restore borders.
  * Fix vertical scrolling.
* Header: Restore the slight border.
* Added more code examples to the [syntax highlighting demo page](http://mottie.github.io/Github-Dark/).
* Removed unnecessary text truncation
  * See [this list of long file names](https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/tree/master/entries) and commit descriptions.
  * The commit descriptions are already truncated, so even after removing the max width of the content, the text is still cut off.
  * Restored truncation in the News Feed.

#### Version 1.4.1 (11/1/2013)

* userstyles.org does not allow having namespace variables inside of the wrapper
* Added permanent demo link to readme.
